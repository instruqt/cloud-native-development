      This curriculum will teach you **cloud-native patterns** which you can apply at work or on your own project.

      Learning how to apply these patterns is not the main purpose of the curriculum however. The main purpose is to learn **how** to apply them in **the right context**.

      Ultimately this will bring the most **value** to you as a developer, your organisation and the user you’re building the application for. In other words, we want to look at what problems are solved with these solutions and when such a pattern is the right tool for the right job. We don’t want to blindly follow certain patterns without knowing in which cases they are useful, and in which not.

      build your own solutions from scratch. If you’re working on a greenfield project
      this sounds great. However, there is a good chance you’re dealing with an existing
      system which is not (or only partly) cloud-native, but which you would like
      to transition into something more cloud-native. Think of building a system as
      a microservice architecture from scratch versus transitioning from a monolith
      into such a system. \n\nThese **transformative patterns** are very useful and
      are also part of this curriculum."

      After finishing this training you’ll know:
      - what cloud-native development is
      - the cloud-native context and its basic principles
      - what problem each pattern tries to solve
      - the advantages and disadvantages of certain patterns
      - how to exactly apply these patterns with specific cloud offerings
